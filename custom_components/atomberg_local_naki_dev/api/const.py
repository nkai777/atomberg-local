"""Protocol constants for local Atomberg fan control.

Two transports reach the same fan:

* Wi-Fi  - JSON command datagram to UDP :5600; the fan broadcasts a presence
           beacon and full state on UDP :5625.
* BLE    - the same JSON commands written to the command characteristic; state
           read from the state characteristic. Works with no Wi-Fi at all.

The fan is identified by its stable ``device_id`` (its Wi-Fi MAC, e.g.
``a1b2c3d4e5f6``). Both transports expose it, so a fan seen over BLE and later
over Wi-Fi is the same logical device.
